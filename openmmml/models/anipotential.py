    """This is the MLPotentialImpl implementing the ANI potential.

    The potential is implemented using TorchANI to build a PyTorch model.  A
    TorchForce is used to add it to the OpenMM System.  The ANI1ccx and ANI2x
    versions are currently supported.

    Both ANI1ccx and ANI2x are ensembles of eight models.  Averaging over all eight
    models leads to slightly more accurate results than any one individually.  You
    can optionally use only a single model by specifying the modelIndex argument to
    select which one to use.  This leads to a large improvement in speed, at the
    cost of a small decrease in accuracy.

    TorchForce requires the model to be saved to disk in a separate file.  By default
    it writes a file called 'animodel.pt' in the current working directory.  You can
    use the filename argument to specify a different name.  For example,

    >>> system = potential.createSystem(topology, filename='mymodel.pt')
