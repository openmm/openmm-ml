    """Implementation of the DeePMD (Deep Potential Molecular Dynamics) potential for OpenMM.
    
    This class provides an interface to use DeePMD neural network potentials in OpenMM simulations through the OpenMMDeepmdPlugin. 
    DeePMD potentials are trained using the DeepMD-kit framework and can provide highly accurate quantum mechanical-level forces and energies for molecular dynamics simulations.
    
    The DeePMD potential supports various advanced features including:
    - Alchemical free energy calculations with lambda parameters  
    - NNP/MM-style region selection
    - Custom unit conversions between different simulation packages
    
    Prerequisites:
        - OpenMMDeepmdPlugin must be installed: 
          `conda install -c conda-forge ye-ding::openmm_deepmd_plugin`
        - A trained DeePMD model file (.pb format from DeepMD-kit)
    
    Usage:
        The DeepmdPotentialImpl is typically used through the MLPotential interface:
        
        ```python
        from openmmml import MLPotential
        import openmm.app as app
        
        # Load your system
        pdb = app.PDBFile('system.pdb')
        
        # Create DeePMD potential
        potential = MLPotential('deepmd', model='model.pb',
                                coordinatesCoefficient=10.0,
                                forceCoefficient=964.8792534459,
                                energyCoefficient=96.48792534459)
        
        # Create system with DeePMD forces
        system = potential.createSystem(
            topology=pdb.topology,
            atoms=None,  # Use all atoms, or specify subset
        )
        ```
        
        For alchemical simulations:
        
        ```python
        # Create system with lambda parameter for free energy calculations
        potential = MLPotential('deepmd', model='model.pb')
        system = potential.createSystem(
            topology=pdb.topology,
            lambdaName='lambda_alchemical',
            lambdaValue=0.5,  # Lambda value between 0 and 1
        )
        
        # During simulation, you can also update lambda value through the context:
        context.setParameter('lambda_alchemical', new_lambda_value)
        ```
        
        For NNP/MM-style simulations with atom subsets:
        
        ```python
        forcefield = ForceField('amber14-all.xml', 'amber14/tip3pfb.xml')
        mm_system = forcefield.createSystem(topology)
        
        # Define NNP region atoms (0-indexed)
        nnp_atoms = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]  # First 5 atoms
        
        potential = MLPotential('deepmd', model='model.pb')
        nnp_mm_system = potential.createMixedSystem(
            topology=pdb.topology,
            system=mm_system,
            atoms=nnp_atoms,  # Only these atoms use DeePMD
        )
        ```
    
    Note:
        The default unit conversion coefficients are set up for converting between
        DeePMD-kit's native units (Angstrom, eV) and OpenMM's units (nm, kJ/mol).
        Modify these coefficients if your model uses different units.
