        To use this method, first create a System that is entirely modeled with the
        conventional force field.  Pass it to this method, along with the indices of the
        atoms to model with this potential (the "ML subset").  It returns a new System
        that is identical to the original one except for the following changes.

        1. Removing all bonds, angles, and torsions for which *all* atoms are in the
           ML subset.
        2. For every NonbondedForce and CustomNonbondedForce, adding exceptions/exclusions
           to prevent atoms in the ML subset from interacting with each other.
        3. (Optional) Removing constraints between atoms that are both in the ML subset.
        4. Adding Forces as necessary to compute the internal energy of the ML subset
           with this potential.

        Alternatively, the System can include Forces to compute the energy both with the
        conventional force field and with this potential, and to smoothly interpolate
        between them.  In that case, it creates a CustomCVForce containing the following.

        1. The Forces to compute this potential.
        2. Forces to compute the bonds, angles, and torsions that were removed above.
        3. For every NonbondedForce, a corresponding CustomBondForce to compute the
           nonbonded interactions within the ML subset.

        The CustomCVForce defines a global parameter called "lambda_interpolate" that interpolates
        between the two potentials.  When lambda_interpolate=0, the energy is computed entirely with
        the conventional force field.  When lambda_interpolate=1, the energy is computed entirely with
        the ML potential.  You can set its value by calling setParameter() on the Context.
